                               jpcap .dll README


  This file contains instructions for users who downloaded the 
  Windows .dll only.


  This file is not useful without:

    o The corresponding jpcap classes

    o The libpcap library for windows


  The jpcap classes in .jar format is included in the .tar.gz distribution 
  which can be downloaded at:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27207


  This .dll is provided to help Windows users who don't have the tools 
  or skills to build the jpcap native library from source.

  Still, some familiarity with Java and Windows development is required to 
  get jpcap classes, libpcap for Windows, and this .dll to work together.


  See the file README and other documents in the ./docs directory for more 
  information.
